Hi, I'm Robin. I'm a data scientist, and the lead author of [Splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink).

I've previously led work on the [MoJ's Analytical Platform](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/04/05/pushing-the-boundaries-of-data-science-with-the-moj-analytical-platform/) and prior to that, I was a government economist.

I'm love open source and believe working on software that can improve data is one of the most effective ways for me to help others.

I'm a trustee and secretary of [GiveDirectly UK](https://www.givedirectly.org.uk/), a charity that allows you to give money directly to people living in extreme poverty. Donate here: [UK](https://www.givedirectly.org/uk/) | [rest of world](https://www.givedirectly.org.uk/donate).

I'm also a [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) pledgee.
